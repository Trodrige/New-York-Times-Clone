# New-York-Times-Clone

This is the third Microverse projects and our first together. It entails replicating a page of [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0). The aim is to learn how floats and positioning works, the entire clone is built without using the flex box or grid.

# Features!
